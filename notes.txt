FUTURE

0. performance

1. fullsize image 'gallery' with next/prev arrows: // doesnt really make sense as not all images are loaded... maybe all thumbnails should load, but not be revealed until scroll down 

2. fullsize images popup animation?


5. for noscript need new styles (separate sylesheet?) for images - keep it simple

6. arty 404

7. scroll to bottom -> add enough pictures so that fold is covered again

8. is 300 ms throttle too much? Does throttle have to fire all the time?

3. breakpoints on homepage should match breakpoints in galery?

7. change favicon?

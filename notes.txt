ASAP
1. add contact and (i) info floating icons to top right of every page

2. Favicon

3. click on images to get fullsize

4. domain? naked domain forwarding?

5. back button on gallery pages (little minimalist arrow to left of title?)







FUTURE
5. for noscript need new styles (separate sylesheet?) for images - keep it simple

6. arty 404

7. scroll to bottom -> add enough pictures so that fold is covered again

8. is 300 ms throttle too much? Does throttle have to fire all the time?

3. breakpoints on homepage should match breakpoints in galery?

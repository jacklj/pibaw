DADS Feedback Wed 3rd Feb 2016
1. front page - dont put text on images. solutions:
	i. black squares instead of pictures (dads)
	ii. pictures with writing below on coloured bar (me)
	iii. simple text list (me)

2. gallery: one photo per screen, with right and left arrows. no zoom for now

3. no conversations

4. when click on main logo on homepage, info page pops up (and info logo)



ASAP

2. link from dads website, and mine







FUTURE

0. performance

1. fullsize image 'gallery' with next/prev arrows: // doesnt really make sense as not all images are loaded... maybe all thumbnails should load, but not be revealed until scroll down 

2. fullsize images popup animation?


5. for noscript need new styles (separate sylesheet?) for images - keep it simple

6. arty 404

7. scroll to bottom -> add enough pictures so that fold is covered again

8. is 300 ms throttle too much? Does throttle have to fire all the time?

3. breakpoints on homepage should match breakpoints in galery?

7. change favicon?
